# KaeBot
A constantly WIP Discord bot written in discord.py. 

# What is KaeBot?
KaeBot is a WIP Discord bot written in the __rewrite__ branch of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper for Python.
Currently, KaeBot is in the alpha stage of development. As such, parts of it are likely bugged. This is subject to change as development progresses.

# Invite KaeBot to your Discord server
As KaeBot is currently in active development, I have no plans to release a public invite link for KaeBot *for now*.

# Host KaeBot on your own computer/server
...please don't. Not only will you have to set up a PostgreSQL database in a specific way for certain functions to work, you'll have to gather API keys for various services. You'll then have to organise your API keys and pSQL information into files that are either pickled or organised in JSON files, depending on how the core script accesses the information. It's just not worth it; there are plenty of other Discord bots you can host on your own computer.
You're more than welcome to try, though.
