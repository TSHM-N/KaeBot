# KaeBot
A constantly WIP Discord bot written in discord.py. 

# What is KaeBot?
KaeBot is a WIP Discord bot written in the __rewrite__ branch of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper for Python.
Currently, KaeBot is in the alpha stage of development, lacks several essential features and is very heavily bugged. This is subject to change as development progresses.

# Invite KaeBot to your Discord server
As KaeBot is currently in active development, I have no plans to release a public invite link for KaeBot *for now*.
