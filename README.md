# KaeBot
A constantly WIP Discord bot written in discord.py. 

# What is KaeBot?
KaeBot is a WIP Discord bot written in the __rewrite__ branch of the [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) API wrapper for Python. KaeBot currently features a wide array of commands, built-in database support and over a thousand total lines of code.
Currently, KaeBot is in the alpha stage of development.

# Invite KaeBot to your Discord server
As KaeBot is currently in active development, I have no plans to release a public invite link for KaeBot *for now*.

# KaeBot's Cogs
Currently, KaeBot features several cogs:
#### Administration `Administrator`
#### Moderation `Moderator`
#### KaeRPG
#### Miscellaneous Commands `Miscellaneous`
#### Genius Interface `Genius`
#### Seasonal Commands `Seasonal`
More cogs, as well as more commands for existing cogs, are currently planned (see *Roadmap/Milestones/TODO*).

# Roadmap/Milestones/TODO
See the project [TODO.](TODO)

# Host KaeBot on your own computer/server
KaeBot requires specific database setup and API keys for several services. As such, it is highly recommended not to attempt hosting KaeBot; it is not designed to be hosted on other computers.
